# Hello

I'm a Japanese technical college student and programmer. I write HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, C, and C++. I also compete on AtCoder.

## about me

My name is Nagisa Kazetomari.
I'm a Japanese student at a technical college, majoring in information technology.
I can write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, and C++.
(C and C++ are still new to me, so I'm just getting started with them.)
I'm active on AtCoder — my algorithm rating is Brown, and my heuristic contest rating is Green.

## Achievements

- AtCoder Algorithm Contest: Brown-rated (with performances reaching Cyan level)
- AtCoder Heuristic Contest: Green-rated (with performances reaching Cyan level)

## Interests & Learning

I'm currently focusing on learning C and C++,　while also studying Python for AtCoder.
My goal is to create executable software.

I love mathematics, so I'd like to develop calculation-related software.

I prefer CRLF as my line ending style,　and I'm against calling software "apps" or "applications".

My main editor is VSCode, and I really like the Monokai color scheme.
